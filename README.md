# Coffee Delivery â€¢ React Challenge

In this challenge, I will develop an application to manage a shopping cart for a fictional coffee shop, which contains the following features:

- List of products (coffees) available for purchase
- Add a specific number of items to the cart
- Increase or remove the number of items in the cart
- Form for the user to fill in their address
- Display the total items in the cart in the Header
- Display the total value of the sum of items in the cart multiplied by the value

Using concepts such as:

- States
- ContextAPI
- LocalStorage
- Immutability of the state
- Lists and keys in ReactJS
- Properties
- Componentization
